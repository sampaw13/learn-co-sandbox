# we have two hashes, one which maps state names to state abbreviations, and one which maps state abbreviations to their capital:
          
 capitals = { "NC" => "Raleigh"
             "WI"  =>  "Madison"
             "CA"  =>  "Sacramento"
             "NY"  =>  "Albany" }
              
              
#Level 1: Write some code which given a state name (ex. NC) outputs its capital (Raleigh)

capitals[]

def city_search(capitals, state)
  puts "#{capitals[states]}"

    
end 





#Level 2: Handle a case when a state's information is not known by returning "unknown"



#Level 3: Now let's go the other way. Given a capital name (Madison), return the state name for which it is the capital (Wisconsin).
